# NameFolderSort
This Program sorts/edits the given path. It copies files into the given keyword-folders based on the keyword.
It will compare the keywords to every file in every folder and copies matching files into the keyword-folder.

1. Download the newest release.
2. The program has to be started via the terminal with "java -jar FolderSort.jar".
3. Once started, it will ask for the main path. After that you can specify the keywords (e.g.: hello;hi;hey;...;). If you've entered everything correctly, the files will be copied    to the keyword-folders.

Note:
The keywords have to be lowercase. Directories inside folders won't be copied to the keyword-folder.
